# COVID-19-Data-Analysis
This repository contains Python code for analyzing COVID-19 cases country-wise. The analysis includes insights into confirmed cases, active cases, fatalities, recoveries, and other related metrics. The project utilizes various Python libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Express.

# Libraries Used
The analysis is performed using the following Python libraries:
* Pandas (pd)
* NumPy (np)
* Matplotlib.pyplot (plt)
* Seaborn (sns)
* Plotly Express (px)

# Insights Provided
The COVID-19 data analysis provides the following insights:
* Grouping by WHO Region: The DataFrame is grouped by the 'WHO Region' column, and the sum of confirmed cases for each region is plotted on a bar graph.
* Top 10 Countries with Active Cases: A bar graph is plotted to visualize the top 10 countries/regions with the highest number of active cases.
* Correlation Coefficients: The correlation coefficients between selected columns are calculated and analyzed.
* Fatality and Recovery Rate: The fatality and recovery rates are visualized using scatter plots to understand the relationship between them.
* New Cases by Country: A pie chart is used to represent the top 10 countries with the highest number of new cases.
* Deaths vs. Recovered: A scatter plot is created to visualize the relationship between deaths and recoveries.
* Countries with Maximum Death Cases: A bar graph displays the top 10 countries with the maximum number of COVID-19 death cases.
* Confirmed Cases vs. Deaths: The relationship between confirmed cases and deaths by country/region is analyzed and visualized.
